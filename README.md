# Interstellar
<h3>Intro</h3>
<p>Interstellar is a proxy created by InterstellarNetwork. It is the best proxy in my opinion, to the point that I starred the original repo, and gave positive feedback.</p>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>Create a github account and fork this repo.</p>
<p>Go to cyclic.sh and make an account using the github account you created in the previous step.</p>
<p>Go to app.cyclic.sh and click on link your own.</p>
<p>Click on the field that Search repositories or something like that.</p>
<p>Click on IS or the name of the repo you forked in step one.</p>
<p>Click on Connect Cyclic.</p>
<p>Wait until you see celebration confetti on the screen.</p>
<p>You will see two links. Copy the first one and go to it. Done !</p>
