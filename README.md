# Interstellar
<h3>Intro</h3>
<p>Interstellar is a proxy created by InterstellarNetwork. It is the best proxy in my opinion, to the point that I starred the original repo, and gave positive feedback.</p>
<p>Anyways, here are instructions.</p>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>1: Make a github account and fork this repo.</p>
<p>2: Click on the green &lt;&gt;Code &or; button.</p>
<p>3: Click on codespaces.</p>
<p>4: Click on the green button that you see just appeared.</p>
<p>5: Wait until you see a preview of these instructions or some coloured code on the screen.</p>
<p>6: Click on the button Terminal which will be in the middle of your screen.</p>
<p>7: On the very right of the address bar near the top of your screen is a star. Click on it, and then click Ok or click Done. Now you can go back to it anytime.</p>
<p>8: If you see a $ under the word terminal, click to the right of the $ sign.</p>
<p>9: Type npm install and press enter on your keyboard/</p>
<p>10: Wait until you see a thick white line next to a $ sign, then continue to the next step.</p>
<p>11: Type npm run start and press enter on your keyboard.</p>
<p>12: Click on Make Public on the bottom right of your screen.</p>
<p>13: If it does not redirect you to another page, click on Ports.</p>
<p>13: Hover over https:// which will be quite close to the word Ports, then click the sphere with squares in it.</p>
<p>14: Click Ok on the popup that opens.</p>
<p>15: At the very right of your address bar, you will see a red circle, click on it.</p>
<p>16: You will see two circles, click the one that is not blue, then hold the Ctrl key on your keyboard while clicking the letter r on your keyboard.</p>
<p>Now heres how to do it later when you closed everything you just opened.</p>
<p>1: Click on the bookmark you created from the previous step 7.</p>
